*Scaffold out a TestCafe reporter*

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/DevExpress/generator-testcafe-reporter.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/DevExpress/generator-testcafe-reporter)

TestCafe can build test run reports in your own format and style. All you need is a custom reporter plugin.
This Yeoman generator scaffolds out such a plugin, so that you will need to write only a few lines of code.

For more information, read [Custom Reporter Plugin](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/extending-testcafe/custom-reporter-plugin/).
