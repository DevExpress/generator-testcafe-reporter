*Scaffold out a TestCafe reporter*

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/DevExpress/generator-testcafe-reporter.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/DevExpress/generator-testcafe-reporter)

TestCafe can build test run reports in your own format and style. What you have to do is create a custom reporter plugin.
This Yeoman generator scaffolds out such a plugin, so that you only need to write a few lines of code.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-testcafe-reporter using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-testcafe-reporter
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo generator-testcafe-reporter
```
